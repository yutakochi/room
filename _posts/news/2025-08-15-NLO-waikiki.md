I presented my research orally at the Optica Nonlinear Optics Topical Meeting in Waikiki, USA (Aug 4-7, 2025).  

Although students in my lab in Japan were busy just before the Obon holidays, I was able to enjoy an early summer vacation.

I was curious about the Hawaiian summer, but it was the dry season with low humidity, cool, and very comfortable. Evenings were slightly chilly. Of course, I had to prepare for my oral presentation, but overall it was a very enjoyable vacation.

This was my first time attending such a small, specialized conference, and I found all the talks closely aligned with my interests and very engaging. Many leading experts, including Prof. Boyd, participated, making it a high-level and inspiring meeting.
